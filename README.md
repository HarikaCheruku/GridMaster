<h1>Grid Master</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Grid Master is a reinforcement learning-based project that implements the Q-learning algorithm to solve the Frozen Lake environment. 
It demonstrates how agents can learn to navigate grid-based environments, optimizing their actions to maximize rewards while avoiding pitfalls. 
The project serves as an educational tool to better understand reinforcement learning concepts by offering a clear visualization of the agent's training and performance.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Q-learning Implementation:</strong> Demonstrates agent learning and decision-making in the Frozen Lake environment.</li>
  <li><strong>Training Visualization:</strong> Displays real-time rendering of the agent's gameplay during training.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> Calculates and displays the average reward over multiple episodes.</li>
  <li><strong>Interactive Web Interface:</strong> Provides a user-friendly interface to trigger training, view results, and analyze the Q-table.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python (NumPy for Q-learning Implementation)</li>
  <li>Gymnasium for the Frozen Lake environment</li>
  <li>Flask application for frontend visualization</li>
</ul>
